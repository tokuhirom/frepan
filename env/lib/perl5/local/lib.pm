=head1 NAME

local::lib - create and use a local lib/ for perl modules with PERL5LIB

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In code -

  use local::lib; # sets up a local lib at ~/perl5

  use local::lib '~/foo'; # same, but ~/foo

  # Or...
  use FindBin;
  use local::lib "$FindBin::Bin/../support";  # app-local support library

From the shell -

  # Install LWP and its missing dependencies to the 'my_lwp' directory
  perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib=my_lwp -e 'CPAN::install(LWP)'

  # Install LWP and *all non-core* dependencies to the 'my_lwp' directory 
  perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib=--self-contained,my_lwp -e 'CPAN::install(LWP)'

  # Just print out useful shell commands
  $ perl -Mlocal::lib
  export MODULEBUILDRC=/home/username/perl/.modulebuildrc
  export PERL_MM_OPT='INSTALL_BASE=/home/username/perl'
  export PERL5LIB='/home/username/perl/lib/perl5:/home/username/perl/lib/perl5/i386-linux'
  export PATH="/home/username/perl/bin:$PATH"

=head2 The bootstrapping technique

A typical way to install local::lib is using what is known as the
"bootstrapping" technique.  You would do this if your system administrator
hasn't already installed local::lib.  In this case, you'll need to install
local::lib in your home directory.

1. Download and unpack the local::lib tarball from CPAN (search for "Download"
on the CPAN page about local::lib).  Do this as an ordinary user, not as root
or administrator.  Unpack the file in your home directory or in any other
convenient location.

2. Run this:

  perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap

If the system asks you whether it should automatically configure as much
as possible, you would typically answer yes.

3. Run this:

  make test && make install

4. Arrange for Perl to use your own packages instead of the system
packages.  If you are using bash, you can do this as follows:

  echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >>~/.bashrc

If you are using C shell, you can do this as follows:

  /bin/csh
  echo $SHELL
  /bin/csh
  perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib >> ~/.cshrc

You can also pass --bootstrap=~/foo to get a different location -

  perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap=~/foo
  make test && make install

  echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/foo/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib=$HOME/foo)' >>~/.bashrc

After writing your shell configuration file, be sure to re-read it to get the
changed settings into your current shell's environment. Bourne shells use C<.
~/.bashrc> for this, whereas C shells use C<source ~/.cshrc>. Replace .bashrc or
.cshrc with the name of the file you wrote above with the echo command.

If you're on a slower machine, or are operating under draconian disk space
limitations, you can disable the automatic generation of manpages from POD when
installing modules by using the C<--no-manpages> argument when bootstrapping:

  perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap --no-manpages

If you want to install multiple Perl module environments, say for application development, 
install local::lib globally and then:

  cd ~/mydir1
  perl -Mlocal::lib=./
  eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=./)  ### To set the environment for this shell alone
  printenv  ### You will see that ~/mydir1 is in the PERL5LIB
  perl -MCPAN -e install ...    ### whatever modules you want
  cd ../mydir2
  ... REPEAT ...

For multiple environments for multiple apps you may need to include a modified
version of the C<< use FindBin >> instructions in the "In code" sample above.
If you did something like the above, you have a set of Perl modules at C<<
~/mydir1/lib >>. If you have a script at C<< ~/mydir1/scripts/myscript.pl >>,
you need to tell it where to find the modules you installed for it at C<<
~/mydir1/lib >>.

In C<< ~/mydir1/scripts/myscript.pl >>:

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use local::lib "$FindBin::Bin/..";  ### points to ~/mydir1 and local::lib finds lib
  use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";     ### points to ~/mydir1/lib

Put this before any BEGIN { ... } blocks that require the modules you installed.

=head2 Differences when using this module under Win32

  C:\>perl -Mlocal::lib
  set MODULEBUILDRC=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5\.modulebuildrc
  set PERL_MM_OPT=INSTALL_BASE=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5
  set PERL5LIB=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5\lib\perl5;C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5\lib\perl5\MSWin32-x86-multi-thread
  set PATH=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5\bin;%PATH%
  
    ### To set the environment for this shell alone
  C:\>perl -Mlocal::lib > %TEMP%\tmp.bat && %TEMP%\tmp.bat && del %TEMP%\temp.bat
  ### instead of $(perl -Mlocal::lib=./)

If you want the environment entries to persist, you'll need to add then to the
Control Panel's System applet yourself at the moment.

The "~" is translated to the user's profile directory (the directory named for
the user under "Documents and Settings" (Windows XP or earlier) or "Users"
(Windows Vista or later) unless $ENV{HOME} exists. After that, the home
directory is translated to a short name (which means the directory must exist)
and the subdirectories are created.

=head1 RATIONALE

The version of a Perl package on your machine is not always the version you
need.  Obviously, the best thing to do would be to update to the version you
need.  However, you might be in a situation where you're prevented from doing
this.  Perhaps you don't have system administrator privileges; or perhaps you
are using a package management system such as Debian, and nobody has yet gotten
around to packaging up the version you need.

local::lib solves this problem by allowing you to create your own directory of
Perl packages downloaded from CPAN (in a multi-user system, this would typically
be within your own home directory).  The existing system Perl installation is
not affected; you simply invoke Perl with special options so that Perl uses the
packages in your own local package directory rather than the system packages.
local::lib arranges things so that your locally installed version of the Perl
packages takes precedence over the system installation.

If you are using a package management system (such as Debian), you don't need to
worry about Debian and CPAN stepping on each other's toes.  Your local version
of the packages will be written to an entirely separate directory from those
installed by Debian.  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a user-local Perl
module library located within the user's home directory. It also constructs and
prints out for the user the list of environment variables using the syntax
appropriate for the user's current shell (as specified by the C<SHELL>
environment variable), suitable for directly adding to one's shell
configuration file.

More generally, local::lib allows for the bootstrapping and usage of a
directory containing Perl modules outside of Perl's C<@INC>. This makes it
easier to ship an application with an app-specific copy of a Perl module, or
collection of modules. Useful in cases like when an upstream maintainer hasn't
applied a patch to a module of theirs that you need for your application.

On import, local::lib sets the following environment variables to appropriate
values:

=over 4

=item MODULEBUILDRC

=item PERL_MM_OPT

=item PERL5LIB

=item PATH

PATH is appended to, rather than clobbered.

=back

These values are then available for reference by any code after import.

=head1 CREATING A SELF-CONTAINED SET OF MODULES

You can use local::lib to prepare a directory which contains a module and all
of its non-core dependencies.  The C<--self-contained> option ignores any
globally installed modules when resolving dependencies, only considering
modules installed in a "local::lib" directory or provided by core Perl.

A use-case for this feature would be to prepare to deploy a whole "stack" of
module dependencies on a new machine, even if you have copies of the same
dependencies installed globally already.

The C<--self-contained> option should be used like this: 

  # Install LWP and *all non-core* dependencies to the 'my_lwp' directory 
  perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib=--self-contained,my_lwp -e 'CPAN::install(LWP)'

Note that some dependencies may involve C-based "XS" code even if your target
module doesn't. The issue of dealing with XS vs Pure Perl code is beyond the scope
of what local::lib provides.

library installation: L</resolve_empty_path>, L</resolve_home_path>,
L</resolve_relative_path>. Passes the given path argument to
L</resolve_empty_path> which then returns a result that is passed to
L</resolve_home_path>, which then has its result passed to
L</resolve_relative_path>. The result of this final call is returned from
L</resolve_path>.

=head1 A WARNING ABOUT UNINST=1

Be careful about using local::lib in combination with "make install UNINST=1".
The idea of this feature is that will uninstall an old version of a module
before installing a new one. However it lacks a safety check that the old
version and the new version will go in the same directory. Used in combination
with local::lib, you can potentially delete a globally accessible version of a
module while installing the new version in a local place. Only combine "make
install UNINST=1" and local::lib if you understand these possible consequences.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Rather basic shell detection. Right now anything with csh in its name is
assumed to be a C shell or something compatible, and everything else is assumed
to be Bourne, except on Win32 systems. If the C<SHELL> environment variable is
not set, a Bourne-compatible shell is assumed.

Bootstrap is a hack and will use CPAN.pm for ExtUtils::MakeMaker even if you
have CPANPLUS installed.

Kills any existing PERL5LIB, PERL_MM_OPT or MODULEBUILDRC.

Should probably auto-fixup CPAN config if not already done.

Patches very much welcome for any of the above.

On Win32 systems, does not have a way to write the created environment variables
to the registry, so that they can persist through a reboot.

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

If you've configured local::lib to install CPAN modules somewhere in to your
home directory, and at some point later you try to install a module with C<cpan
-i Foo::Bar>, but it fails with an error like: C<Warning: You do not have
permissions to install into /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux at
/usr/lib64/perl5/5.8.8/Foo/Bar.pm> and buried within the install log is an
error saying C<'INSTALL_BASE' is not a known MakeMaker parameter name>, then
you've somehow lost your updated ExtUtils::MakeMaker module.

To remedy this situation, rerun the bootstrapping procedure documented above.

Then, run C<rm -r ~/.cpan/build/Foo-Bar*>

Finally, re-run C<cpan -i Foo::Bar> and it should install without problems.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item SHELL

=item COMSPEC
